# Block Spam Calls. Powered by Twilio - Node.js/Express
![](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-node/workflows/Node.js/badge.svg)

> We are currently in the process of updating this sample template. If you are encountering any issues with the sample, please open an issue at [github.com/twilio-labs/code-exchange/issues](https://github.com/twilio-labs/code-exchange/issues) and we'll try to help you.

Learn how to use Twilio add-ons to block spam calls.

Follow the beginning of the [Block Spam Calls and RoboCalls guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/block-spam-calls-and-robocalls-python) to learn how to add the spam filtering add-ons.

### Create a TwiML App

This project is configured to use a **TwiML App**, which allows us to easily set the voice URLs for all Twilio phone numbers we purchase in this app.

To create a new TwiML app click [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps).

### Install Add-ons

The following guide will help you to [install Add-ons](https://www.twilio.com/docs/add-ons/install). You can access the Add-ons in the Twilio console [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/add-ons). The Spam Filtering Add-ons that are used on this application are:
- [Ekata Phone Validation](https://showcase.twilio.com/s/partner-listing/a8E1W00000097QEUAY)
- [Marchex Clean Call](https://showcase.twilio.com/s/partner-listing/a8E1W00000097QxUAI)
- [Nomorobo Spam Score](https://showcase.twilio.com/s/partner-listing/a8E1W00000097R7UAI)

Once you've selected the Add-on, just click on `Install` button. Then, you will see a pop-up window where you should read and agree the terms, then, click the button `Agree & Install`. For this application, you just need to handle the incoming voice calls, so make sure the `Incoming Voice Call` box for `Use In` is checked and click `Save`

## Local development

First you need to install either [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), which
should also install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To run the app locally, clone this repository and `cd` into its directory:

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into its directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/block-spam-calls-node.git
   cd block-spam-calls-node
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Run the application.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

To actually forward incoming calls, your development server will need to be publicly accessible. [We recommend using ngrok to solve this problem](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html).

Once you have started ngrok, update your TwiML app's voice URL setting to use your ngrok hostname, so it will look something like this:

```
http://88b37ada.ngrok.io/
```

## Run the tests

You can run the tests locally by typing

```
npm test
```
